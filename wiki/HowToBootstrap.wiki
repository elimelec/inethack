#summary How to bootstrap iNetHack on Mac OS X.
#labels nethack,bootstrapping

= Introduction =

I could have sworn I had created a page for this, but apparently not ... *There's usually no need to do this.* Exceptions are changes to the core, like versions, or if you want to update the nethack branch completely (but then you'll have to do a lot more to patch).

= Details =

All commands to be executed from nethack top level directory.

Create makefiles:

  * cd sys/unix; sh setup.sh

Build TTY NetHack:

  * cd util ; make makedefs
  * cd src ; ../util/makedefs -v

Some additional targets you have to update occasionally:

  * make dungeon
  * cd src ; make tile.c
