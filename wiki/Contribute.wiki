 * If you'd like to contribute source code append your patch to the issues it solves (if the issue does not yet exist create it).
 * If you regularly send quality patches and you'd like to be a maintainer I will add you to the team.
 * If you'd like to contribute something else, also create an issue (with a means for contacting you).
