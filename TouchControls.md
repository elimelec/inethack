# Introduction #

The touch controls are merely a fine layer over the usual (tty port) NetHack commands (see [NetHack Commands (Guidebook)](http://www.nethack.org/v343/Guidebook.html#_TOCentry_7)).

# Movement #

  * Tap on the main screen (not the buttons!) and your PC will move one step into the general direction. You can tap into the message or status texts.
  * Tap and hold for some time and your PC will continue to move into the general direction until something interesting is found (g + movement in normal NetHack).

# Level Overview #

Simply drag (touch and move) to move your view of the level. Tap again to enter normal movement mode.

# Shortcuts #

Those buttons above and below the level overview will generally issue the keystroke(s) they're labeled with, so a button named '99s' will search 99 times.

The one labeled 'abc' will open a keyboard, the 'menu' will open the main menu.
